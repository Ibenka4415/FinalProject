# FinalProject
html pong game
credit for the pong game goes to Matt Mongeau
I did edit a lot of his code to try to fit what i need some tampering worked out better than other attempts.

-What was originally planned for your final project:
I originally playned to do a python app but found out that was hard so i switched over to html and was alot easier.
-What was delivered in your Final Project:
I was able to implment a large interactive piece of java code into my assinment and able to host it on a web page.
-What would be the next feature(s) you would add if you had more time:
if i could figure it out i would want to add a score board to the game but looking at there code is really hard.
-Contact information for yourself if someone wanted to contact you about continuing to enhance your application:
